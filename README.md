# Chat-application
Web Chat Application using Golang and Vue.js

#Running the Application
To run the application, open a console window and make sure you are in the "src" directory of your application then run the following command.

```
$ go run main.go

```
Next open a web browser and navigate to "http://localhost:8000". The chat screen will be displayed and you can now enter an email and username.


To see how the app works with multiple users, just open another browser tab or window and navigate to "http://localhost:8000". Enter a different email and username. Take turns sending messages from both windows.


This just a basic chat application but there are many more improvements you can make to it. I challenge you to play around with the source code and add some other features, see if you can implement private messaging or notifications when a new user joins or leaves the chat. The sky is the limit!

I hope you found this helpful and are now inspired to start creating your own realtime applications using WebSockets and Go.
